üö¶ Traffic Sign Classification Using Classical Digital Image Processing Techniques
This project implements a complete rule-based traffic sign classification system using only classical digital image processing techniques. Unlike modern machine learning approaches, all image analysis tasks are performed using manual operations with NumPy and basic Python libraries.

üìå Objective
To develop an end-to-end traffic sign classifier capable of identifying signs based on their color, shape, and geometric features using traditional image processing techniques such as:

Filtering

Segmentation

Feature extraction

Rule-based classification
